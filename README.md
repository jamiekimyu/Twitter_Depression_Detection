## Depression Detection Through User Behavior on Twitter

Depression is an increasingly prevalent public health burden, yet many individuals do not receive proper treatment due to not being properly diagnosed. This project explores the possibility of accurately detecting depression through a person’s behavior on Twitter. We achieve this by identifying a group of depressed and non-depressed users, mining their tweets and identifying a set of features that can be used to classify for depression. We experiment with Bag of Words and supervised machine learning methods such as SVM, Logistic Regression, and n-gram Naïve Bayes classifiers.
